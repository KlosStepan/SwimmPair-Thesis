\chapter{Deployment}
Development of our application was performed locally using \textbf{docker-compose} to glue up 4 components necessary to sufficiently orchestrate \underline{PHP container} for web application, \underline{MySQL container} + \underline{Adminer container} and \underline{Redis container}.
\par
We have to, however, run our application in \textbf{Kubernetes Cluster}. \textbf{Services} and \textbf{Deployments} have to be written. Services for the purpose of routing and taking care of new container spawn addresses. Deployments to describe container definitions - images \& volumes, number of replicas and environment variables. \textbf{Database} is run as a separate standalone entity within the cluster with persistent storage, \textbf{Redis} for syncing and preserving sessions as well.

\end{figure}
Both \textbf{Database} and \textbf{Redis} can be substituted by Managed Databases\footnote{\url{https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases}} or their equivalents in different cloud providers. They can be accessed remotely as dedicated self-hosted services within your own company as well.
\par \textbf{SwimmPair} can be run using Container Service or "1-click app" as well. 
\section*{Dockerization of SwimmPair application}
A file called \textbf{Dockerfile} has to be ready in the project folder.
\begin{lstlisting}
FROM thecodingmachine/php:7.4-v4-apache
COPY --chown=docker . /var/www/html
\end{lstlisting}
This image of PHP7.4/Apache\footnote{Image \textbf{thecodingmachine/php:7.4-v4-apache}  by TheCodingMachine - \url{https://github.com/thecodingmachine/docker-images-php}} was chosen because it correctly dockerizes part of so-called LAMP stack. In order to build this image and push it into Docker Hub we run following commands:
\begin{lstlisting}
docker build -t stepanklos/swimmpair .
docker push stepanklos/swimmpair
\end{lstlisting}
This image is then pullable as stepanklos/swimmpair:latest by Deployment\footnote{\url{https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/stepanklos/swimmpair/general}}.
\section*{Kubernetes}
We run two replicas on two nodes to ensure reliability and uptime. Additionally, we have set up an autoscaler to accommodate future increases in traffic.

\end{lstlisting}    
\section*{Database and Redis}
As mentioned, our application does not come with a database (and Adminer) or Redis, so we had to set them up separately using a PV (persistent storage) on which a PVC (persistent volume claim) was created. Due to Digital Ocean's policy on PersistentVolume implementation, we had to run these services as 1 pod with manual volume, which is sufficient for our workload.
\newline
These two services we set up are internally accessible as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item MySQL Database\footnote{\url{https://github.com/KlosStepan/DOKS-configs/tree/main/mysql-deployment}}: \textbf{mysql-service:3306} ,
    \item \textbf{Re}mote \textbf{Di}ctionary \textbf{S}erver: \footnote{\url{https://github.com/KlosStepan/DOKS-configs/tree/main/redis-deployment}} \textbf{redis-service:6379} ,
\end{itemize}
in our Kubernetes Cluster.
