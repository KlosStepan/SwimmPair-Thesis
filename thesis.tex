% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
The goal of this project is to streamline the management process for swimming competitions in the Czech Republic. To achieve this, we are developing a system with a user-friendly web interface that is also mobile-friendly. The system will include all necessary infrastructure and utilize a MySQL database for data storage. Backend tasks will be handled by extensible PHP managers. For the frontend, we are implementing a custom drag-and-drop DOM API in JavaScript to improve the user experience.

%%%
%%% The printed version should preferably contain attachments, which can be
%%% read (additional tables and charts, supplementary text, examples of
