Being born in mid 90s has given me the  opportunity to observe development of personal computing and advent of internet first-hand. By the time I was three I was fortunate enough to experience my father's first computer running Windows 98. By the time I was five I already knew I wanted to be a programmer when I grow up. I realized that I could write some lines and make a public website. I've been fascinated by Microsoft and Apple, by Bill Gates, Steven Balmer, Paul Allen and by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. They are the geniuses who put computers on our tables and iPhones in our pockets. This is, however, just brief overview of my fascination by IT world.
\subsection*{Why web applications}
\par
Dot-com bubble crash was correction of overhyped optimism stemming from new technologies in early 2000s, subsequently helping whole industrz to mature. It was year 2008 and financial crisis that brought the real opportunities in the web space. Despite having made an average American customer poorer, it has brought the world new trend of money saving services that were meant for cutting the cuts or making extra cash. To save money, one didn't call a taxi, you called UBER. To make extra money one started renting an extra room at AirBnB. Distrust in banking industry created Bitcoin and made us think of other uses of blockchain. It is not hard to see that these things are not as technically complicated as one would think. A CS grad with correct ammount of enthusiasm should be able to deploy a MVP of each thing previously mentioned in couple of weeks or months.
\subsection*{Motivation}
\par
This thesis is a fullstack system meant for my fellow to save time for more important tasks which he has as a chief swimming referee and manager. This is valuable training for me since I have to forge a solution of problem vaguely resembling one of the MVPs listed above. Having delved into this problem rewarded me with valuable experiences and insights. These experiences are hopefully going to help me in my future endeavors and career.
\par
I realized that Software and Data Engineering is a crucial craftmanship for delivering these positive changes. Building things is the modern adventure.
