Being born in mid 90s has given me the  opportunity to observe development of personal computing and advent of internet first-hand. By the time I was three I was fortunate enough to experience my father's first computer running Windows 98. By the time I was five I already knew I wanted to be a programmer when I grow up. I realized that I could write some lines and make a public website. I've been fascinated by stories of Microsoft and Apple. These companies put computers on our tables and iPhones in our pockets. This is, however, just brief overview of my motivation about IT world.
\subsection*{Why web applications}
\par
 Dot-com bubble crash was correction of overhyped optimism stemming from new technologies in early 2000s, subsequently helping whole industry to mature. It was year 2008 and financial crisis that brought the real opportunities in the web space. Despite having made an average American customer poorer, it has brought the world new trend of money saving services that were meant for cutting the cuts or making extra cash. To save money, one didn't call a taxi but UBER operated by another individual on the other side. To make extra money one started renting an extra room at Airbnb. Distrust in banking industry and monetary policy created Bitcoin. It is not hard to see that some of these things are not as technically complicated as one would think. A good software engineer should be able to deploy MVP of each thing previously mentioned in couple of weeks or months.
\subsection*{Motivation}

This thesis is a fullstack web application meant for my fellow friend to save him time for more important tasks which he has to perform as a chief swimming referee and club manager. This is valuable training for me since I have to forge a solution of problem vaguely resembling one of the MVPs listed above. Having delved into this problem rewarded me with valuable experiences, insights and lessons. These lessons are hopefully going to help me in my future endeavors and career.

Software engineering is a crucial craftmanship for delivering positive changes in contemporary world. Building things is this modern adventure.
