Being born in mid 90s has given me the  opportunity to observe development of personal computing and the internet first-hand. By the time I was three I was fortunate enough to experience my father's first computer running Windows 98. By the time I was five I already knew I wanted to be a programmer when I grow up. I realized that I can write some lines and make a public website. I've been fascinated by Microsoft and Apple, by Bill Gates, Steven Balmer, Paul Allen and by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. They are the geniuses who put computers on our tables and iPhones in our pockets. This is, however, just brief overview of my fascination by IT world.
\subsection*{Why applications like this}
\par
Dot-com bubble crash was correction of optimism from new technologies in early 2000s subsequently maturing whole industry. It was year 2008 and financial crisis that brought the real opportunities. Despite having made an average American customer poorer, it has brought to world plenty of money saving services that were meant for cutting the costs or making extra cash. To save money, you didn't call a taxi, you called a UBER. You rented your extra room at AirBnB to secure extra stream of income. Distrust in banking industry created Bitcoin and made us think of other uses of blockchain. It's not hard to see these things are not as technically complicated as one would think. A CS grad with correct ammount of enthusiasm should be able to deploy a MVP of each thing previously mentioned in several weeks or a couple of months.
\subsection*{Motivation}

This thesis is a full-stack system meant for my friend to save him time for more important tasks which he has, as a chief swimming referee, obligation to do. This is an valuable training for me since I have to forge a solution to problem vaguely resembling one of the problems listed above. Having delved into this problem rewarded me with invaluable experiences and insights which are hopefully going to help me in my future endeavors.

I realized that Software and Data Engineering is the crucial craftship that I have to master. The more of this I know the easier it is for me to deploy whatever own project comes to my mind. Building things is adventure.
