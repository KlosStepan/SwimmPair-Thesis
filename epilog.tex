\chapter*{Conclusion}
Endeavor of designing, development and shipping of this web application was overally successful. There are some parts, that can be improved or extended in the future, however, our system is ready for this and lessons have been learned.
\par
Speaking of lessons, design/development part was not as straightforward as theoretics would have appreciated, but rather it was done iteratively with cooperation of system requester.  
\newline
The stages of iterations are roughly:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Problem description + basic pages layouts programming (homepage, cup, user, club).
  \item Model formalization and proper division of code into system objects and task functions.
  \item Statistics on data (user, club), additional pages for categorization purposes.
  \item Addition of Regions for futher extensible hierarchisation.
  \item Major final refactoring of database, backend and testing with dummy data insertion and querying.
  \item Cloud ready, Docker image of web application and Kubernetes Deployment.
\end{enumerate}
  Further system extesions might be related to adding \textbf{new public pages}, \textbf{statistical queries}, \textbf{administrative tasks addition} -  these are pages addition, model adjustment and minor design changes. All types of modifications can be accomodated thanks to divided code and the changes might consist of modifying style, model classes enhancement, database procedures addition etc. Future modifications will reside in the the project GitHub repository \footnote{https://github.com/KlosStepan/SwimmPair-Www}.
